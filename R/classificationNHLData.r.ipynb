It seems that the scoring is not as easily put in correlation with any of the other categories. The clearest line is drawn between shots and score, but score and faceoffs in Cells 1,4 (4,1) and score and takeaways in Cells 1,3 (3,1) are clearly intertwined with some other hidden variables involved. In a next step we attempt the introduction of another class."
